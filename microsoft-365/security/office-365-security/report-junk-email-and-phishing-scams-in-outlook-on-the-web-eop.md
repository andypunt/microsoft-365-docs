# Report junk and phishing email in Outlook on the web in Exchange Online

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft 365 Defender rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender-for-office.md)]

**Applies to**
- [Exchange Online Protection](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2148611)
- [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 plan 1 and plan 2](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2148715)
- [Microsoft 365 Defender](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2118804)

In Microsoft 365 organizations with mailboxes in Exchange Online, you can use the built-in reporting options in Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App) to submit false positives (good email marked as spam), false negatives (bad email allowed) and phishing messages to Exchange Online Protection (EOP).

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- If you're an admin in an organization with Exchange Online mailboxes, we recommend that you use the Submissions portal in the Security & Compliance Center. For more information, see [Use Admin Submission to submit suspected spam, phish, URLs, and files to Microsoft](admin-submission.md).

- Admins can disable or enable the ability for users to report messages to Microsoft in Outlook on the web. For details, see the [Disable or enable junk email reporting in Outlook on the web](#disable-or-enable-junk-email-reporting-in-outlook-on-the-web) section later in this article.

- You can configure reported messages to be copied or redirected to a mailbox that you specify. For more information, see [User submissions policies](user-submission.md).

- For more information about reporting messages to Microsoft, see [Report messages and files to Microsoft](report-junk-email-messages-to-microsoft.md).

## Report spam and phishing messages in Outlook on the web

Admins should use the Report Message or the Report Phishing add-in experience to report messages: https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/enable-the-report-message-add-in
